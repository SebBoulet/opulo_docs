    !!! danger "Watch Out"
        Make sure that when you feed film into your peel gears, you guide the film away from the worm gear. It's important to prevent it from getting caught between the worm gear and a peel gear, as this can damage the peel gear. Ensure your film doesn't get caught when loading film.

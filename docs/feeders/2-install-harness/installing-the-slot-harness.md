# Installing the Slot Harness

This is an IDC cable with a number of connectors attached to it, and three PCB/3D print sub-assemblies.

The individual feeder floors bolt onto the front (or back) rail on your machine, and allow the feeder to communicate with the motherboard.

Attach three feeder floors onto your front rail, with the printed peg on the back side of the rail, and the gold-plated pads facing up at you. Mount using an allen key.
Be sure that all three of them are placed at least 100mm away from the far left of the rail, and 30mm apart from each other. 
Make sure your machine is powered off. One end of the harness will have a plug inserted into the connector; this contains the termination resistor for the bus. Take the remaining end of the harness with the empty connector, and plug it into the 2x3 IDC connector on your motherboard to the left of the R and A stepper drivers. 
Plug your machine back in.


2nd: Staging Plate Positioning
We need to make sure that the staging plate is shifted back far enough that the feeders will fit in comfortably. Loosen the four screws mounting the staging plate to the machine.
Slide the staging plate back so that the front edge is exactly 75mm away from the front rail. This is shown below using the spacing jig that comes included with v3 LumenPnPs.

Tighten the staging plate back down to the machine.

1. Before mounting, install your spool arm. Unscrew the allen key in the spool arm slot, insert the spool arm upright, and replace the screw.

    !!! note "A Bit of Force is OK"
        It can take a bit of force to mount your feeder, especially the first few times as the print breaks in. As long as you are aligned correctly, you can put a bit of force into mounting the feeder.

7. You should see the status light blink gold, indicating that the feeder has booted up.

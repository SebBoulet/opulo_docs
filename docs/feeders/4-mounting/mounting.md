# Mounting Feeders and Loading Tape

## Mounting a Feeder

A feeder can be mounted to your LumenPnP with one smooth motion.

1. Hold your feeder at a 45 degree angle downwards.
2. Align the peg on the slot with the channel in the feeder.
3. Ensure the notch in the feeders' extrusion cutout grabs into the extrusion.
4. Pull in on the locking arm.
5. Pull down on the feeder until it pops into place.
   
    !!! note "A Bit of Force is OK"
        It can take a bit of force to mount your feeder, especially the first few times as the print breaks in. As long as you are aligned correctly, you can put a bit of force into mounting the feeder.

6. Release the lever arm.

A feeder can be mounted on your LumenPnP with one smooth motion.

## Insert Feeder

!!! note "Powder on the Rail"
      You might notice that a small amount of dust or powder develops on your machine's feeder rail. This is totally ok. The feeder prints are designed to be just a little undersized, so that they wear in to exactly the right fit over a few insertion cycles.

!!! note "A Bit of Force is OK"
      It can take a bit of force to mount your feeder, especially the first few times as the print breaks in. As long as you are aligned correctly, you can put a bit of force into mounting the feeder.

1. Hold your feeder at a 45 degree angle downwards.

2. Align the peg on the slot with the channel in the feeder.

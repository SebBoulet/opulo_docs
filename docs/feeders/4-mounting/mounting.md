# Mounting Feeders

A feeder can be mounted on your LumenPnP with one smooth motion.

1. Before mounting, install your spool arm. Unscrew the allen key in the spool arm slot, insert the spool arm upright, and replace the screw.

    !!! note "A Bit of Force is OK"
        It can take a bit of force to mount your feeder, especially the first few times as the print breaks in. As long as you are aligned correctly, you can put a bit of force into mounting the feeder.

7. You should see the status light blink gold, indicating that the feeder has booted up.

7. Release the lever arm.

!!! note "Powder on the Rail"
    You might notice that a small amount of dust or powder develops on your machine's feeder rail. This is totally ok. The feeder prints are designed to be just a little undersized, so that they wear in to exactly the right fit over a few insertion cycles.

# Feeder Overview

This is the Opulo 8mm Feeder:

![hero image of feeder8](img/feeder-gold-glow.png)

The 8mm feeder is an open source SMT component tape feeder that can reliably feed components as small as 0402. It is designed to work with a LumenPnP Pick and Place Machine, but can mount onto any 20mm X 20mm v-slot extrusion.

The feeder uses the open source Photon feeder controller firmware, and talks the Photon protocol over RS-485 to any Marlin host with RS-485 support.

## Loading Tape

This video shows how tape is loaded into the feeder, and the functionality of the buttons.

# Nozzle Tip Runout Compensation ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/h3mtEQfGMlM?si=FHauQ0aEZQaOBkxV&t=1661))

Nozzle Tip Runout Compensation measures how the nozzle tip's position shifts when the nozzle rotates. This shift is detected using the bottom camera. The compensation algorithm adjusts for any misalignment, ensuring more accurate placement. This process eliminates errors caused by runout, which can occur from either the nozzle tip or the nozzle itself. The calibration system automatically compensates for any combination of these factors. This section will be walking you through calibrating both nozzles.

!!! note
    Runout can originate from either the nozzle tip or the nozzle it is attached to. The calibration system automatically handles both.

## Nozzle Tip Runout Compensation for Nozzle: N1 (left toolhead)

!!! note "Important: Read this if you're continuing from the previous steps."  
    If you have just completed the previous steps, Nozzle: N1 should already be centered over the bottom camera. **Do not move it.** Skip to step 4 to continue.  

1. **Select Nozzle: N1**.
    * (If Nozzle: N1 is already centered over the bottom camera, please skip to step 4.)
    * From the `Machine Controls` dropdown, select `Nozzle: N1 - N045 (Head:H1)`.
     ![](../7-bottom-camera-position/images/select-n1-machine-control-bottom.webp)
<br/><br/>

1. **Open the bottom Camera Settings**.
    * Navigate to `Machine Setup > Cameras > OpenPnPCaptureCamera Bottom`.
     ![Switching to the camera device settings](images/Bottom-camera-device-settings.webp)
<br/><br/>

1. **Position Nozzle: N1 over the Bottom Camera**.
    * Open the **"Position"** tab, then click the `Position the tool over the center of the location` button.
<br/><br/>

1. **Adjust the exposure using the slider**.
    * üö® **Keep all other camera settings at their default value, and only adjust the exposure slider**.
    * In the lower detail pane, switch to the `Device Settings` tab.
     ![Switching to the camera device settings](images/Bottom-camera-device-settings.webp)
    * Right click on the camera feed and select `Show Image Info?` to enable the image info card. This will give you the brightness histogram of the image.
     ![enable the image histogram](images/show-image-info.webp)
    * Aim for a **sharp peak on the right side** and a larger **cluster to the left** in the histogram. See the image below for reference.
     ![a good histogram](images/bottom-exp-good.webp){: style="width:60%;margin-left:10%;"}
    !!! Warning "üö® Important üö®"
        The reference image below is just an example‚Äî**your histogram may look very different** depending on lighting conditions, camera placement, and other environmental factors. **Do not try to match it exactly.** Instead, focus on achieving the key characteristics: a distinct peak on the right and a noticeable cluster to the left. Adjust gradually until the image is clear and well-exposed.

2. **Set the Correct Exposure**.
    * Adjust the exposure slider to ensure the camera can clearly detect the dark hole in the nozzle tip for calibration. The exposure should be balanced‚Äîbright enough to distinguish the nozzle tip from the background but not so bright that the hole becomes difficult to detect. Aim for a setting where the brightest areas are visible but do not appear completely white, and the darker areas remain well-defined. Use the following images as a reference for adjusting exposure:
     ![exposure too high](images/bottom-exp-high.webp)
     ![exposure too low](images/bottom-exp-low.webp)
     ![exposure correct](images/bottom-exp-good.webp)
<br/><br/>

1. **Record and Save Your Exposure Value**
    * OpenPnP may not retain camera settings after restart **Record and save your exposure value** by saving them in a text file or writing them down.
    * This means every time you boot up OpenPnP you'll have to:
        * Toggle **Auto Exposure** `on`, then `off`. (This puts your camera into manual exposure mode)
        * **Type your recorded exposure value into the exposure field beside the slider**.
<br/><br/>

1. **Calibrate the N045 Nozzle Tip**.
    * Navigate to `Machine Setup > Nozzle Tips > N045 > Calibration`, and click the `Calibrate` button.

     ![click the calibrate button for n045](images/n045-calibrate-button.webp)

    !!! warning
        If calibration fails with an error message stating, "...Too many vision misdetects...", click the Pipeline `Edit` button to [adjust the nozzle tip vision pipeline](../../vision-pipeline-adjustment/4-nozzle-calibration-pipeline.md)for Nozzle Tip N045, then retest.

         ![click pipeline edit button](images/n045-edit-pipeline.webp)
<br/><br/>

1. **Set Auto Recalibration**.
    * After successfully calibrating, Auto Recalibration should be set to `NozzleTipChange`. If it is set to `Manual`, change the Auto Recalibration setting from `Manual` to `NozzleTipChange`. This ensures that OpenPnP automatically recalibrates any loaded `N045` nozzle tips after homing or swapping tips.

<br/><br/>

1. **Confirm Final Exposure Settings for Nozzle: N1**.
    * If further exposure adjustments were necessary, update your saved exposure value for Nozzle: `N1` . You'll need it when restarting OpenPnP.
<br/><br/>

1. **Apply and Save**
    * Click `Apply` in the lower right corner to save your changes.
    * Save your OpenPnP configuration now. `File > Save Configuration`.

## Final Check

!!! danger "üö® Critical Warning: Level Nozzles üö®"
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **You must ensure that your nozzles are level**.<br/><br/>
    **Failure to do this can cause crashes and potentially damage your machine.**<br/><br/>
    Use the `P` between the Z-axis up/down arrows to ensure the nozzle tips are out of the way. The `P` stands for **Parking** the nozzle out of the way into a safe height that won‚Äôt collide with any objects.
      ![level nozzles](images/level-nozzles.webp)

1. **Retest the N045 Calibration**.
    * If you made any changes to the bottom camera exposure settings when calibrating Nozzle: `N2`, **retest the** `N045` **nozzle calibration** to ensure the settings are compatible and the calibration works with the new exposure.
<br/><br/>

1. **Home the LumenPnP**.
    * Level the nozzles to prevent collisions before homing.
    * Perform a homing of the LumenPnP to ensure that fiducial detection and nozzle tip calibration finish successfully for the `N1` and `N2` nozzles without errors.
<br/><br/>

1. **Record Final Exposure Settings for Nozzle: N2**.
    * Once you've finalized your exposure setting for the bottom camera, **record the exposure value. You'll need it when restarting OpenPnP**. We recommend saving these values to a text file and storing it somewhere convenient.

# OpenPnP

OpenPnP is a piece of open source software designed to control pick and place machines. It supports a wide range of machines, with many features found in high-end commercial software. You can find out more about it [here](https://openpnp.org/).

**Please use the OpenPnP version we link to in the following pages.** OpenPnP has many frequent updates, and some of them change or remove functionality. Keeping to our recommended version ensures that things work correctly and that this documentation is accurate for you. Also, our recommended version has support for the LumenPnP feeders.

## Recommended Hardware

OpenPnP is designed to run on many different kinds of host computers. However, USB drivers and internal USB hub bandwith can vary between computers. We recommend using a Lenovo Thinkpad T470 running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for known good connectivity with your cameras, exposure control, and serial communication.

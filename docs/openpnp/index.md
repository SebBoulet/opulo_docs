# OpenPnP

OpenPnP is a piece of open source software designed to control pick and place machines. It supports a wide range of machines, with many features found in high-end commercial software. You can find out more about it [here](https://openpnp.org/).

These guides were designed with OpenPnP version `2022-08-01_18-07-09.2a36a8d`, so the UI screenshots will match this version, but they should work for other versions as well (namely the [updated version of OpenPnP used for feeders](../feeders/3-software-update/software-update.md)).

## Recommended Hardware

OpenPnP is designed to run on many different kinds of host computers. However, USB drivers and internal USB hub bandwith can vary between computers. We recommend using a Lenovo Thinkpad T470 running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or Ubuntu 22.04 LTS for known good connectivity with your cameras, exposure control, and serial communication.

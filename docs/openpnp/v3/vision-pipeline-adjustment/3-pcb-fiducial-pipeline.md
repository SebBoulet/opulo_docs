# PCB Fiducials Pipeline ([Video Guide](https://youtu.be/RVMS6vJzJyU?si=-dzIkANilr8o8j56&t=18))

Just like the homing fiducial, fiducial markers are used to precisely identify the location of your PCB. The tuning process is identical but takes place in a different section of the OpenPnP UI.

1. Go to the `Vision` tab.

5. Follow the same procedure outlined in the [Homing Fiducial Pipeline](2-homing-fiducial-pipeline.md#check-the-debug-results) section.

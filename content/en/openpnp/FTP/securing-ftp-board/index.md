  Securing the FTP Board
---

Note: it is not required that you mount your FTP board in the exact same location as described below. If you follow these steps you will have a slightly easier time setting the location of the board in OpenPnP, but if you need to set up a board somewhere else on the staging plates, that is totally fine, too.

1. Loosely screw in the universal mounting components in the following locations:
   1. A tabbed holder in $$
   2. A flat holder diagonally in $$
   3. A flat holder horizontally in $$

2. Place the FTP board in the holders and push them so that they're snug against the sides of the board.

3. Tighten down the holders. You shouldn't be able to move the board except by pressing on the tab holding it in place.

4. If you installed your holders in this location, the bottom left corner of your FTP board should be located around XXXX YYYY.

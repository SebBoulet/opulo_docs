  Using the FTP to set up your LumenPnP.
---


## **What you'll learn**

This guide is focused on performing basic calibration for your LumenPnP with the "Getting Started Kit," which is also included in the LumenPnP v3. These docs will walk you through the calibrating and setting up your first job for your LumenPnP. If you don't have an FTP PCB you can still follow along with your own PCB, or follow the more general [Calibration]({{< relref "calibration" >}}) steps instead.

## **What you'll need**

- A LumenPnP with the mechanical and electrical build completed.
- The "Getting Started Kit" with:
  - A FTP PCB
  - 0603 Resistors and LEDs in tape reels
  - Universal Mounting Kit pieces
  - Printed tray feeders
- Read through the [OpenPnP Wiki](https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/User-Manual). It'll be super important to getting going with your machine. **These docs are meant to augment the OpenPnP docs, not replace them.**

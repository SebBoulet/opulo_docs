  Mounting components to the staging plate 
---

We now have the main structure of the machine assembled! Now we'll mount some components to the bottom of the staging plate.

## Overview

Refer to the images below for referencing where to mount parts on the staging plate.

## Soldering Pump

| Qty | Part               |
|----:|--------------------|
|   1 | Vacuum Pump        |
|   1 | Vacuum Pump Wire (Labeled "P1")  |
|   2 | Heatshrink (small) |

Some LumenPnP kits shipped with a pump that had its connector pre-soldered to it. If your pump is not pre-soldered, follow along here to prepare your pump.

1. Gather your Pump, the pump wire (labeled "P1"), and two lengths of heatshrink.
  {{< container-image path="images/Soldering Pump overview.jpg" alt="the necessary components to prepare the pump" >}}

2. Slip the heatshrink over the two exposed leads of the wire.
  {{< container-image path="images/Heatshrink slipped on leads.JPG" alt="Heatshrink slipped over the exposed leads of the pump wire" >}}

3. Wrap the red wire around the left lead as shown in the image below. Wrap the black wire around the right lead.
  {{< container-image path="images/wires wrapped around leads.JPG" alt="Red wire wrapped around the left lead, black wire warped around the right lead" >}}

4. Solder both wires to the pump leads. The polarity does not matter.
  {{< container-image path="images/wire soldered.JPG" alt="Wire soldered to the pump" >}}

5. Slip the heat shrink over the solder joints and motor lead. Use a hot air gun, lighter, or other heat source to shrink the heatshrink.

## Pump mount

| Qty | Part                  |
|----:|-----------------------|
|   1 | FDM-0025 (Pump Mount) |
|   4 | M3 Hex Nuts           |
|   2 | Rubber Band           |
|   1 | Vacuum Pump           |
|   2 | M3x10 machine screw   |

The first thing we'll mount to the staging plate is the {{< tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025" >}}. This print suspends the pump using two rubber bands to ensure none of the vibration of the pump is transferred into the frame.

6. Start by press-fitting M3 nuts into the side recesses in the {{< tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025" >}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-1-2.png" alt="Two Nut locations on the Pump Mount" >}}

7. Now we'll mount the pump in the {{< tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025" >}} using a couple rubber bands. Start by grabbing the rubber band with both hands, giving it a half twist, and folding it over on itself, making two loops.
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0737.JPG" alt="" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0738.JPG" alt="" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0740.JPG" alt="" >}}

8. Now stretch each rubber band over each pair of pegs on the {{< tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025" >}}. Guide the pump between each pair of bands so that it's suspended in the {{< tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025" >}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0742.JPG" alt="" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0743.JPG" alt="" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0744.JPG" alt="" >}}

9. Mount the {{< tooltip "Pump Mount" "FDM-0025" >}} to the staging plate using two M3 x 10mm screws in the location shown below, F31 and F33.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-4-ALT.png" alt="Mounting position for the Pump" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0741.JPG" alt="The Pump assembly mounted on the staging plate" >}}

|   1 | Blowoff Valve          |
|   4 | M3 Hex Nut             |
|   6 | M3x8 machine screw     |

Now we'll attach the {{< tooltip "Valve Mount" "FDM-0042" >}} to the staging plate.

10. Press fit four M3 nuts into the recesses in the {{< tooltip "Valve Mount" "FDM-0042" >}}.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-5.png" alt="four nut locations in the Valve Mount" >}}

11. Use two M3x8mm screws to attach the valve to the {{< tooltip "Valve Mount" "FDM-0042" >}} as shown below.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-6.png" alt="attaching the valve to the valve mount with two screws" >}}

12. Use four M3x8mm screws to mount the {{< tooltip "Valve Mount" "FDM-0042" >}} to the staging plate in the location shown: E23, E25, G23, G25.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-7-ALT.png" alt="attaching the valve to the staging plate" >}}

## Bottom camera mount

| Qty | Part                       |
|----:|----------------------------|
|   1 | FDM-0019 (Up Light Mount)  |
|   1 | FDM-0020 (Up Camera Mount) |
|   1 | Up Ring Light PCB          |
|   1 | USB Camera (Bottom)        |
|   4 | M3x30 machine screw        |
|   4 | M3 Hex Nut                 |
|   4 | M2.5x8 machine screw       |

1. Slide the Up Ring Light into the {{< tooltip "Up Light Mount" "FDM-0019" >}}. The cable connector and LEDs should be facing the printed part, away from the camera in this photo.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating The Staging Plate 10.png" alt="Assembling the Up Ring Light stack 1" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating The Staging Plate 11.png" alt="Assembling the Up Right Light stack 2" >}}

10. Stack the {{< tooltip "Up Camera Mount" "FDM-0020" >}} {{< tooltip "Up Light Mount" "FDM-0019" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating The Staging Plate 12.png" alt="Assembling the Up Camera stack 3" >}}

11. Loosen the screw on the camera so that we can adjust the camera's focus later. Even after doing so, it still might be difficult to rotate the lens. A light grip with some pliers and a gentle twist can help break the lens free and make it easier to rotate by hand. **Make sure your lens is loose before mounting it.**

12. Stack the Up Camera in the {{< tooltip "Up Camera Mount" "FDM-0020" >}}. The cable connector for the camera should be as close to the cable connector for the Up Ring Light as possible, as pictured below.
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0837.JPG" alt="Final assembly of the Up Camera and Up Ring Light, with proper cable orientation" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating The Staging Plate 13.png" alt="Assembling the Up Camera stack 4" >}}

13. Use four M2.5x8mm screws to mount the camera into the {{< tooltip "Up Camera Mount" "FDM-0020" >}} by using the inner set of four holes and tapping directly into the plastic.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating The Staging Plate 14.png" alt="Assembling the Up Camera stack 5" >}}

14. If you have the fiberglass PCB staging plate, you'll need to install a support foot to keep the staging plate sturdy. Stack the Foot Mount on top of the assembly. If you have the metal staging plate, you can skip this step.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating The Staging Plate 15.png" alt="Assembling the Up Camera stack 6" >}}

15. If you have the fiberglass PCB staging plate, push four M3 nuts into the recesses in the Foot Mount.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating The Staging Plate 16.png" alt="Assembling the Up Camera stack 7" >}}

16. Use four M3x30mm screws and four M3 nuts mount the whole assembly to the staging plate: D18, B20, D20, F22 (if you have the fiberglass staging plate, these will be the nuts you installed in the previous step). The cable connector for the Up Ring Light should be facing down and to the left, away from the valve.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating The Staging Plate 19.png" alt="Assembling the Up Camera stack finished with metal staging plate" >}} 
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating The Staging Plate 17.png" alt="Assembling the Up Camera stack 8" >}}

17. Ensure that your bottom camera matches the orientation to the image below.
  {{< container-image path="images/Populating-The-Staging-Plate-Step-12-ALT.png" alt="Up Camera Location on the staging plate" >}}
  {{< container-image path="images/IMG_0837.JPG" alt="Final assembly of the Up Camera and Up Ring Light, with proper cable orientation" >}}

13. If you have the fiberglass PCB staging plate, note that this is where the foot will get installed when your LumenPnP is ready.
